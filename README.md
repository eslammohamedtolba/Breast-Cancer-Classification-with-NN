# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-NN
This is a breast cancer classifier model that uses a neural network to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign. 

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
-Pandas
-scikit-learn
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-TensorFlow
-Keras

## Overview of the Code
1-Load the Breast Cancer dataset and display the first and last five rows.

2-Data Exploration:
-Calculate the mean values of the dataset features for both malignant and benign tumors.
-Display some statistical information about the dataset.

3-Plot the distribution of all dataset features.

4-Count the groups in the output label column and visualize their repetition.

5-Split the dataset into input features (X) and labels (Y).

6-Scale the input data using StandardScaler.

7-Create a neural network model with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

8-Train the model and visualize the accuracy and loss during training.

9-Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data and make predictions on the test input data.

10-Build a predictive system to classify tumors as malignant or benign for new input data.


## Model Accuracy
The model achieves an accuracy of 98.8% on the test data.


## Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome. 
You can help improve the model's accuracy, explore more advanced neural network architectures, or enhance the data preprocessing and visualization steps.
